Waves - Global Issue Visualizations Web App

This repository comprises the front-end user interface resources of the Waves Global Issues Visualization web application for use by the MIT Media Lab's Human Dynamics Group. These resources are not have been used as a guide for the actual web app and do not comprise the web application itself; they merely mimic the look-and-feel of the web application.

The web application is designed as a application that allows users to anonymously comment on data visualizations on global issues through personal accounts created for the web app. Each user may choose a unique username, and an avatar to be used as their personal identity.

They are able to comment on data visualizations, like and dislike comments by other users, view their comments in a centralized page, edit their profile details, and share the page on popular social networks.
